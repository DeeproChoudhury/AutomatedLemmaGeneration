Then, we prove the inequality `12 * ?y ≤ 9 * ?y^2 + 4` using the `sum_squares_ennreal` lemma, which requires showing that the coefficients are non-negative and that a specific inequality involving squares holds.\n\nAfter proving the inequality, we use it to show the desired inequality by multiplying both sides by `?y` and simplifying the expression using the `field_simps` lemma.\n\nThe relevant lemmas and theorems used in this proof are:\n\n- `sum_squares_ennreal`: Provides a way to prove inequalities using the sum of squares method.\n- `field_simps`: Simplifies expressions involving multiplication and division in a field.\n- `power2_eq_square`: Relates the square of a number to its power raised to 2.\n\nBy following this structured proof, it should be easier to understand the reasoning and translate it into Isabelle\'s formal language.'}], 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 1101, 'output_tokens': 697}}
