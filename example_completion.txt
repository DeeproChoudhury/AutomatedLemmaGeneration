[{'type': 'text', 'text': "Based on the given problem statement, informal proof, and formal statement in Isabelle, I can provide a more structured step-by-step proof that is closer to Isabelle's style, along with requests for relevant lemmas or theorems that might help in proving this problem.\n\n## Structured Informal Proof\n\nStep 1: Introduce a new variable `y` to represent `x * sin x`, and show that the original expression can be rewritten as `(9 * y^2 + 4) / y`.\n\nStep 2: Prove that `y > 0` for `0 < x < pi`.\nLemma required: `sin_pos_range` (proving that `sin x > 0` for `0 < x < pi`)\n\nStep 3: Multiply both sides of the inequality by `y` to get rid of the fraction, reducing the problem to showing that `12 * y ≤ 9 * y^2 + 4`.\n\nStep 4: Use the sum of squares method to prove the inequality `12 * y ≤ 9 * y^2 + 4`.\nLemma required: `sum_of_squares` (stating that `a^2 + b^2 ≥ 2 * a * b` for real numbers `a` and `b`)\n\nStep 5: Conclude that the minimum value of the original expression `(9 * x^2 * sin^2 x + 4) / (x * sin x)` is indeed 12 for `0 < x < pi`.\n\n## Request for Lemmas and Theorems\n\n1. `sin_pos_range`: A lemma stating that `sin x > 0` for `0 < x < pi`.\n\n2. `sum_of_squares`: A lemma stating that `a^2 + b^2 ≥ 2 * a * b` for real numbers `a` and `b`.\n\nThese lemmas would be helpful in proving Steps 2 and 4 of the structured informal proof, respectively.\n\nBy following this structured approach and leveraging the requested lemmas, it should be possible to construct a formal proof in Isabelle for the given problem."}]
