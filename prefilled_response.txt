Find the minimum value of $rac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Let $y = x \sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \leq rac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$. This can be done by the sum of squares method.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Introduce a new variable $y = x\sin x$ to simplify the original expression.
Step 2: Observe that $y > 0$ for $0 < x < \pi$.
Step 3: Multiply both sides of the inequality by $y$ to get rid of the fraction.
Step 4: Rearrange terms to show that it suffices to prove $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$.
Step 5: Apply the sum of squares method to establish $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$.
Step 6: Conclude that the minimum value of the original expression is indeed 12.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
Understanding trigonometric identities and inequalities is crucial to simplify the expression and set up the correct inequality to prove.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma trig_ineq:
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0 < x" "x < pi"
  shows "x * sin x > 0"
```

### Thoughts 2
Familiarity with the sum of squares method and its application to proving inequalities involving polynomials would be highly beneficial for the final step of the proof.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma sum_of_squares:
  fixes x y::real
  shows "12 * (x * y) \<le> 9 * (x * y)^2 + 4"
```

### Thoughts 3
No additional skills or lemmas are required.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma dummy:
  "True"
```

Based on the structured informal proof and the requested skills, here is a potential step-by-step proof in Isabelle:

```isabelle
theorem min_value_expression:
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0 < x" "x < pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"
proof -
  define y where "y = x * sin x"
  have "y > 0" using assms trig_ineq by auto
  hence "12 * y \<le> (9 * y^2) + 4" using sum_of_squares by auto
  thus ?thesis
    using y_def by (auto simp add: field_simps)
qed
```

In this proof, we first introduce the variable `y` and show that it is positive using the `trig_ineq` lemma. We then apply the `sum_of_squares` lemma to establish the inequality `12 * y \<le> (9 * y^2) + 4`. Finally, we use the definition of `y` and some simplification rules to conclude the desired inequality.

Note that the `trig_ineq` and `sum_of_squares` lemmas need to be proven separately, but their proofs are not shown here for brevity.
