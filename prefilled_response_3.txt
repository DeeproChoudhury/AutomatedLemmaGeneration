Find the minimum value of $rac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Let $y = x \sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \leq rac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$. This can be done by the sum of squares method.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"

    and "\<forall>y>0. ((9 * y^2) + 4) / y \<ge> 12"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Recognize that $x \sin x$ is positive in the given domain (0, $\pi$).
Step 2: Let $y = x \sin x$. Our goal is to show $12 \leq \frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}$.
Step 3: Multiply both sides by $y$ (which is positive) to get $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$.
Step 4: Use the sum of squares technique to prove the inequality $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$.
Step 5: Conclude that $12 \leq \frac{9y^2 + 4}{y}$ and hence $12$ is a lower bound for the given expression.
Step 6: Show that the minimum value of the expression is attained at $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and it equals 12.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
The proof requires skills in working with inequalities, using the sum of squares technique, and finding the minimum value of a rational function.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma sum_of_squares:
  fixes y :: real
  assumes "y > 0"
  shows "12 * y \<le> 9 * y^2 + 4"
```

### Thoughts 2
To find the minimum value, we need to analyze the critical points of the rational function and check the boundary values.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma minimum_value_rational_function:
  fixes x :: real
  assumes "0 < x" "x < pi" 
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"
    and "((9 * ((\<pi>/2)^2 * (sin (\<pi>/2))^2)) + 4) / ((\<pi>/2) * sin (\<pi>/2)) = 12"
```

The key lemmas required are:
1. sum_of_squares: To prove the inequality $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$ using the sum of squares method.
2. minimum_value_rational_function: To analyze the critical points and boundary values of the rational function to find its minimum value.

Additionally, knowledge of calculus and techniques for finding extrema of functions would be helpful.
