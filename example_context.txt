As a mathematician and expert in the isabelle theorem prover, your task is to analyze the given theorem (including problem's informal statement, 
human written informal proof, and formal statement). Provide a better structured step by step proof that closer to isabelle. 
and request relevant lemmas, theorems that might help in proving this problem.

## Problems
Show that for positive integer n, 2 divides $4^n$.

## Informal proof
Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$. The conclusion thus follows.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n \<noteq> 0"
  shows "(2::nat) dvd 4^n"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$

## Problems
Determine the value of $ab$ if $\log_8a+\log_4b^2=5$ and $\log_8b+\log_4a^2=7$. Show that it is 512.

## Informal proof
We first calculate that $\log_2=1$, $\log_4=2$, and $\log_8=3$. Then let $c=\log_a$ and $d=\log_b$. We can write the equations as $\frac{c}{3} + 2*\frac{d}{2}=5$ and $\frac{d}{3} + 2*\frac{c}{2}=7$. Solving the equations and we get $c=6$ and $d=3$. Hence $a=2^6=64$ and $b=2^3=8$. Multiply them together and $ab=512$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a b ::real
  assumes 
    "a > 0"
    "b > 0"
    "(log 2 a) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (b^2)) / (log 2 4) = 5"
    "(log 2 b) / (log 2 8) + (log 2 (a^2)) / (log 2 4) = 7"
  shows "a * b = 512"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations, i.e., $\log_2 8 = 3$, $\log_2 4 = 2$.
Step 2: Define $c = \log_2 a$ and $d = \log_2 b$ to simplify the equations.
Step 3: Rewrite the original equations in terms of c and d using the calculated base 2 logarithms. The equations become $\frac{c}{3} + \frac{2d}{2} = 5$ and $\frac{d}{3} + \frac{2c}{2} = 7$.
Step 4: Solve the linear equations to find that $c = 6$ and $d = 3$.
Step 5: Use the values of c and d to find $a = 2^6 = 64$ and $b = 2^3 = 8$.
Step 6: Finally, show that $a * b = 64 * 8 = 512$ to conclude the proof.

### Thoughts 1
It would be particularly helpful to have experience solving systems of linear equations since it required to solve the linear equations in step 4.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma find_a_b_value:
  fixes c d :: real
  assumes 
    "c/3 + d/1 = 5"
    "d/3 + c/1 = 7"
  shows "c = 6 \<and> d = 3"
```

### Thoughts 2
It would be helpful for step 1 if there exists lemma that calculate the base 2 logarithms of the original bases in the equations. 

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma log_base_to_power_equals_exponent:
  fixes a :: real
  assumes "a > 0" "a \<noteq> 1" "n > 0"
  shows "log a (a^n) = n"
```

### Thoughts 3
In step 5 they uses the log definition to calculate the value of a and b, which require to calculate the antilogarithm_identity which calculate the value of $b = a^c$ given $log_a b = c$

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma antilogarithm_identity:
  assumes "a > 0" and "a \<noteq> 1" and "b > 0" and "log a b = c"
  shows "b = a ^ c"
```

## Problems
What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits? Show that it is 18.

## Informal proof
We simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number. Hence $a$ is 1. The two-digit integer is hence $18$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.
Step 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.
Step 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.
Step 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.
