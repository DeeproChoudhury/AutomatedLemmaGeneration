## Problems
When Rachel divides her favorite number by 7, she gets a remainder of 5. What will the remainder be if she multiplies her favorite number by 5 and then divides by 7? Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Let $n$ be Rachel's favorite number.  Then $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n mod 7 = 5"
  shows "(5 * n) mod 7 = 4"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Define Rachel's favorite number as $ n $.
Step 2. since $n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so $5n \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 25 \pmod{7}$
Step 3: Use modular arithmetic to simplify $ 5n (\text{mod} 7) $ into 4.
Step 4: Conclude that the remainder will be 4.

### Thoughts 1
Understanding of modular arithmetic will be crucial, as the proof relies heavily on understanding how remainders behave under multiplication.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma mod_multiply:
  fixes a b c m :: nat
  assumes "a mod m = b"
  shows "(c * a) mod m = (c * b) mod m"

## Problems
What positive two-digit integer is exactly twice the sum of its digits? Show that it is 18.

## Informal proof
We simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$. Since $a$ is at least 1, $b$ is at least 8. We know $b$ is 8 since $8a = b$ and $a$ is a natural number. Hence $a$ is 1. The two-digit integer is hence $18$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes h0 : "1\<le>a \<and> a \<le>9 \<and> b \<le>9"
    and h1 : "10 * a + b = 2 * (a+b)"
  shows "10 * a + b = 18"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1. Simplify $10a + b = 2(a+b)$ to get $8a = b$.
Step 2: Apply the constraint that $a$ is at least 1 to get that $b$ is at least 8.
Step 3: Use the natural number condition for $a$ and $b$ to argue that $b = 8$ and $a = 1$ are the only viable solutions that satisfy the equation and constraints.
Step 4: Conclude that the two-digit integer is $18$ as $10 * 1 + 8 = 18$.

### Thoughts 1
The solver needs to be comfortable working with Diophantine equations and natural numbers to find integer solutions for the given equation.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma find_a_b_integer_solution:
  fixes a b :: nat
  assumes 
    "1 \<le> a \<and> a \<le> 9 \<and> b \<le> 9"
    "10 * a + b = 2 * (a + b)"
  shows "a = 1 \<and> b = 8"

## Problems
Show that for any integer, the residue of its square divided by 3 is either 0 or 1.

## Informal proof
Let $a$ stand for this arbitrary integer. Let $b = a mod 3$. We know that b can only be 0, 1, or 2. Also, $a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3$. If $b=0$, $a^2 mod 3 = 0^2 mod 3 = 0$; If $b=1$, $a^2 mod 3 = 1^2 mod 3 = 1$; If $b=2$, $a^2 mod 3 = 2^2 mod 3 = 1$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes a :: int
  shows "a^2 mod 3 = 0 \<or> a^2 mod 3 = 1"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Introduce a new variable $b$ such that $b = a \mod 3$. This simplifies the expression since $b$ can only be 0, 1, or 2.
Step 2: State that $a^2 \mod 3 = b^2 \mod 3$, which can be proved using the properties of modulo arithmetic.
Step 3: Enumerate the cases for $b$, i.e., $b = 0$, $b = 1$, or $b = 2$.
Step 4: For each case, calculate $b^2 \mod 3$. Show that each case results in either $0$ or $1$.
Step 5: Conclude that for any integer $a$, $a^2 \mod 3$ must be either $0$ or $1$.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
Having an understanding of modular arithmetic is important since the proof involves the modulo operation.
  
### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma modulo_squared_equivalence:
  fixes a b :: int
  assumes "b = a mod 3"
  shows "a^2 mod 3 = b^2 mod 3"
```

### Thoughts 2
The proof requires enumerating cases based on the possible residues of $b$ modulo 3, which are 0, 1, or 2. The ability to perform case analysis is crucial here.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma case_analysis_modulo_3:
  fixes b :: int
  assumes "b = a mod 3"
  shows "b = 0 \<or> b = 1 \<or> b = 2"
```

### Thoughts 3
Since each case results in either $0$ or $1$, familiarity with basic arithmetic and modular operations is required.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma square_modulo_3_cases:
  fixes b :: int
  shows "b^2 mod 3 = 0 \<or> b^2 mod 3 = 1"
```

By addressing these elements, the proof can be made rigorous and comprehensive.
