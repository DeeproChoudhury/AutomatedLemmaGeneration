## Problems
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.

## Informal proof
The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=060$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p1:
  fixes x y z w :: nat
  assumes ht : "1 < x \<and> 1 < y \<and> 1 < z"
    and hw : "0 \<le> w"
    and h0 : "ln w / ln x = 24"
    and h1 : "ln w / ln y = 40"
    and h2 : "ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12"
  shows "ln w / ln z = 60"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form.
Step 2: Raise each equation to the power of 120 to make the exponents of $w$ comparable.
Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$.
Step 4: Simplify the equation to isolate $z^{120}$ and $w$.
Step 5: Convert the resulting equation back to logarithmic form to find $\log_z w$.

## Lemmas
### Lemma 1
A lemma proving the conversion between logarithmic and exponential forms will be beneficial.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma log_exp_conversion:
  fixes b x :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "b ≠ 1" "x > 0"
  shows "log b x = y ⟷ b^y = x"
```

### Lemma 2
A lemma proving the properties of logarithms, specifically the change of base formula, will be beneficial.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma log_change_of_base:
  fixes a b x :: real
  assumes "a > 0" "a ≠ 1" "b > 0" "b ≠ 1" "x > 0"
  shows "log b x = log a x / log a b"
```

### Lemma 3
A lemma proving the properties of logarithms, specifically the product rule, will be beneficial.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma log_product:
  fixes b x y :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "b ≠ 1" "x > 0" "y > 0"
  shows "log b (x * y) = log b x + log b y"
```

These lemmas will help in converting the logarithmic equations to exponential form, manipulating the exponential equations, and converting the final equation back to logarithmic form.
