## Problems
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.

## Informal proof
The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=060$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p1:
  fixes x y z w :: nat
  assumes ht : "1 < x \<and> 1 < y \<and> 1 < z"
    and hw : "0 \<le> w"
    and h0 : "ln w / ln x = 24"
    and h1 : "ln w / ln y = 40"
    and h2 : "ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12"
  shows "ln w / ln z = 60"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:
  - $x^{24} = w$
  - $y^{40} = w$
  - $(xyz)^{12} = w$

Step 2: Raise each equation to the power of 5, 3, and 10 respectively to make the exponents comparable:
  - $x^{120} = w^5$
  - $y^{120} = w^3$
  - $(xyz)^{120} = w^{10}$

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$:
  - $w^5 \cdot w^3 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$

Step 4: Simplify the equation to isolate $z^{120}$:
  - $z^{120} = w^{2}$

Step 5: Convert back to logarithmic form to find $\log_z w$:
  - $\log_z w = 60$

## Lemmas
### Lemma 1
A lemma showing the conversion between logarithmic and exponential forms would be useful.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma log_exp_conversion:
  fixes x y :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0"
  shows "ln y / ln x = z âŸ· x^z = y"
```

### Lemma 2
A lemma showing the properties of logarithms and exponents, specifically the power rule, would be useful.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma log_power_rule:
  fixes x y z :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0" "z > 0"
  shows "ln (x^y) / ln z = y * (ln x / ln z)"
```

### Lemma 3
A lemma showing the multiplication property of logarithms would be useful.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma log_multiplication:
  fixes x y z :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0" "z > 0"
  shows "ln (x * y) / ln z = ln x / ln z + ln y / ln z"
```

These lemmas will help in converting between logarithmic and exponential forms and in manipulating the equations to isolate the desired variable.
