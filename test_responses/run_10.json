## Problems
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.

## Informal proof
The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=060$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p1:
  fixes x y z w :: nat
  assumes ht : "1 < x \<and> 1 < y \<and> 1 < z"
    and hw : "0 \<le> w"
    and h0 : "ln w / ln x = 24"
    and h1 : "ln w / ln y = 40"
    and h2 : "ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12"
  shows "ln w / ln z = 60"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form.
Step 2: Raise each equation to the power of 120 to make the exponents of $w$ comparable.
Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$.
Step 4: Simplify the resulting equation to isolate $z^{120}$.
Step 5: Convert the simplified equation back to logarithmic form to find $\log_z w$.

## Lemmas
### Lemma 1
A lemma showing that if $\log_b a = c$, then $b^c = a$ would be useful for converting between logarithmic and exponential forms.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma log_to_exp:
  fixes a b c :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "b \<noteq> 1" "a > 0"
  shows "log b a = c \<Longrightarrow> b ^ c = a"
```

### Lemma 2
A lemma showing that if $a^b = c$ and $d > 0$, then $(a^b)^d = c^d$ would be useful for raising both sides of an equation to a power.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma exp_power:
  fixes a b c d :: real
  assumes "a > 0" "b \<noteq> 0" "c > 0" "d > 0"
  shows "a ^ b = c \<Longrightarrow> (a ^ b) ^ d = c ^ d"
```

### Lemma 3
A lemma showing that if $a^b = c^b$, then $a = c$ would be useful for simplifying equations where the exponents on both sides are equal.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma exp_eq:
  fixes a b c :: real
  assumes "a > 0" "b > 0" "c > 0"
  shows "a ^ b = c ^ b \<Longrightarrow> a = c"
```

### Lemma 4
A lemma showing that if $\log_b a = c$, then $\log_a b = \frac{1}{c}$ would be useful for converting between logarithms with different bases.

### Code 4
```isabelle
lemma log_base_change:
  fixes a b c :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "b \<noteq> 1" "a > 0" "a \<noteq> 1"
  shows "log b a = c \<Longrightarrow> log a b = 1 / c"
```

These lemmas provide the necessary tools to convert between logarithmic and exponential forms, raise both sides of an equation to a power, simplify equations where the exponents on both sides are equal, and convert between logarithms with different bases. Using these lemmas, the structured informal proof can be followed to prove the theorem in Isabelle.
