## Problems
Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.

## Informal proof
The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=060$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p1:
  fixes x y z w :: nat
  assumes ht : "1 < x \<and> 1 < y \<and> 1 < z"
    and hw : "0 \<le> w"
    and h0 : "ln w / ln x = 24"
    and h1 : "ln w / ln y = 40"
    and h2 : "ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12"
  shows "ln w / ln z = 60"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form.
Step 1.1: From $\log_x w = 24$, we get $x^{24} = w$.
Step 1.2: From $\log_y w = 40$, we get $y^{40} = w$.
Step 1.3: From $\log_{xyz} w = 12$, we get $(xyz)^{12} = w$.

Step 2: Raise each equation to the power of 5 to make the exponents comparable.
Step 2.1: Raise $x^{24} = w$ to the power of 5, we get $x^{120} = w^5$.
Step 2.2: Raise $y^{40} = w$ to the power of 3, we get $y^{120} = w^3$.
Step 2.3: Raise $(xyz)^{12} = w$ to the power of 10, we get $(xyz)^{120} = w^{10}$.

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$.
Step 3.1: Substitute $x^{120} = w^5$ and $y^{120} = w^3$ into $(xyz)^{120} = w^{10}$, we get $w^5 \cdot w^3 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$.

Step 4: Simplify the equation to isolate $z^{120}$.
Step 4.1: Simplify $w^5 \cdot w^3 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$ to get $w^8 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$.
Step 4.2: Divide both sides by $w^8$ to get $z^{120} = w^2$.

Step 5: Convert the exponential equation back to logarithmic form.
Step 5.1: From $z^{120} = w^2$, we get $\log_z w = 60$.

## Lemmas
### Lemma 1
A lemma showing the conversion between logarithmic and exponential forms would be useful for step 1.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma log_exp_conversion:
  fixes x y :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0"
  shows "ln y / ln x = z \<longleftrightarrow> x^z = y"
```

### Lemma 2
A lemma showing the properties of exponents would be useful for step 2.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma exp_properties:
  fixes x y z :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0" "z > 0"
  shows "(x^y)^z = x^(y*z)"
```

### Lemma 3
A lemma showing the properties of logarithms would be useful for step 5.

### Code 3
```isabelle
lemma log_properties:
  fixes x y z :: real
  assumes "x > 0" "y > 0" "z > 0"
  shows "ln (x^y) = y * ln x"
```

These lemmas and the structured proof provide a clear and rigorous path to the solution, closely aligned with the formalism of Isabelle.
