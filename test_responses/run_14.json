Let $x$, $y$ and $z$ all exceed $1$ and let $w$ be a positive number such that $\log_x w = 24$, $\log_y w = 40$ and $\log_{xyz} w = 12$. Find $\log_z w$. Show that it is 060.

## Informal proof
The [[logarithm]]ic notation doesn't tell us much, so we'll first convert everything to the equivalent exponential forms.

$x^{24}=w$, $y^{40}=w$, and $(xyz)^{12}=w$. If we now convert everything to a power of $120$, it will be easy to isolate $z$ and $w$.

$x^{120}=w^5$, $y^{120}=w^3$, and $(xyz)^{120}=w^{10}$.

With some substitution, we get $w^5w^3z^{120}=w^{10}$ and $\log_zw=060$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem aime_1983_p1:
  fixes x y z w :: nat
  assumes ht : "1 < x \<and> 1 < y \<and> 1 < z"
    and hw : "0 \<le> w"
    and h0 : "ln w / ln x = 24"
    and h1 : "ln w / ln y = 40"
    and h2 : "ln w / ln (x * y * z) = 12"
  shows "ln w / ln z = 60"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Convert the logarithmic equations to exponential form.
- From $\log_x w = 24$, we get $x^{24} = w$.
- From $\log_y w = 40$, we get $y^{40} = w$.
- From $\log_{xyz} w = 12$, we get $(xyz)^{12} = w$.

Step 2: Raise each equation to the power of 5 to make the exponents comparable.
- $x^{120} = w^5$
- $y^{120} = w^3$
- $(xyz)^{120} = w^{10}$

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for $x^{120}$ and $y^{120}$ into the equation for $(xyz)^{120}$.
- $(xyz)^{120} = x^{120} \cdot y^{120} \cdot z^{120} = w^5 \cdot w^3 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$

Step 4: Simplify the equation to isolate $z^{120}$.
- $w^5 \cdot w^3 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$
- $w^8 \cdot z^{120} = w^{10}$
- $z^{120} = w^2$

Step 5: Convert back to logarithmic form to find $\log_z w$.
- $z^{120} = w^2$ implies $\log_z w = 60$.

Step 6: Conclude $\log_z w = 60$.

## Lemmas
### Lemma 1
A lemma showing that if $\log_b a = c$, then $b^c = a$ for $b, a > 0$ would be useful for converting between logarithmic and exponential forms.

### Code 1
```isabelle
lemma log_exp_conversion:
  fixes b a c :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "a > 0" "ln a / ln b = c"
  shows "b ^ c = a"
```

### Lemma 2
A lemma showing that if $b^c = a$, then $\log_b a = c$ for $b, a > 0$ would be useful for converting back to logarithmic form.

### Code 2
```isabelle
lemma exp_log_conversion:
  fixes b a c :: real
  assumes "b > 0" "a > 0" "b ^ c = a"
  shows "ln a / ln b = c"
```

These lemmas will help in converting between the logarithmic and exponential forms, which is crucial for the steps in the structured proof.
