As a mathematician and expert in the isabelle theorem prover, your task is to analyze the given theorem (including problem's informal statement, 
human written informal proof, and formal statement). Provide a better structured step by step proof that closer to isabelle. 
and request relevant lemmas, theorems that might help in proving this problem.

## Problems
Show that for positive integer n, 2 divides $4^n$.

## Informal proof
Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$. The conclusion thus follows.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes n :: nat
  assumes h0 : "n \<noteq> 0"
  shows "(2::nat) dvd 4^n"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Since n is positive, we can find a natural number m where $m+1=n$. Then we can show that 2 divides $4^{m+1}$

## Problems
If $321_{b}$ is equal to the base 10 integer 57, find $b$ given that $b>0$. Show that it is 4.

## Informal proof
Converting $321_{b}$ to base 10 and setting it equal to 57, we find that  \begin{align*} 3(b^2)+2(b^1)+1(b^0)&=57 \\ 3b^2+2b+1&=57 \\\Rightarrow\qquad 3b^2+2b-56&=0 \\\Rightarrow\qquad (3b+14)(b-4)&=0 \end{align*}This tells us that $b$ is either $-\frac{14}{3}$ or $4$. We know that $b>0$, so $b=4$.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes b :: real
  assumes h0 : "0<b"
    and h1 : "3 * b^2 + 2 * b + 1 = 57"
  shows "b=4"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Use the quadratic roots formula lemma to find the possible values for b in formula $3b^2+2b-56=0$
Step 2: Calculate the first possible value for b
Step 3: Calculate the second possible value for b
Step 4: Because b is greater than zero, conclude that b must be 4

  assumes "a ≠ 0"
  defines "disc ≡ b^2 - 4 * a * c"
  assumes "disc ≥ 0"
  shows   "a * x^2 + b * x + c = 0 ⟷ x ∈ {(-b - sqrt disc) / (2*a), (-b + sqrt disc) / (2*a)}"

## Problems
What is the remainder when $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 9 + 10$ is divided by 9? Show that it is 1.

## Informal proof
This is true by simple evaluation.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem mathd_numbertheory_466:\n  "(\\<Sum> k< 11. k) mod 9 = (1::nat)"
```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Calculate the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \ldots + 9 + 10 = 55$.
Step 2: Divide 55 by 9. The remainder is 1.

## Problems
Find the minimum value of $rac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Let $y = x \sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \leq rac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$. This can be done by the sum of squares method.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"
