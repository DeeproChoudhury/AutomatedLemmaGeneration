Find the minimum value of $rac{9x^2\sin^2 x + 4}{x\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \pi$. Show that it is 12.

## Informal proof
Let $y = x \sin x$. It suffices to show that $12 \leq rac{9y^2 + 4}{y}. It is trivial to see that $y > 0$. Then one can multiply both sides by $y$ and it suffices to show $12y \leq 9y^2 + 4$. This can be done by the sum of squares method.

## Formal statement
```isabelle
theorem
  fixes x::real
  assumes "0<x" "x<pi"
  shows "12 \<le> ((9 * (x^2 * (sin x)^2)) + 4) / (x * sin x)"


```

## Structured informal proof
Step 1: Let y = x * sin(x) and note that y > 0 for 0 < x < pi.
Step 2: Multiply both sides of the target inequality by y to yield 12y <= 9y^2 + 4.
Step 3: Use the sum of squares method to prove 12y <= 9y^2 + 4.

## Request skills
### Thoughts 1
The key steps are introducing the new variable y, and using the sum of squares technique.

### Code 1 
```isabelle
lemma sum_of_squares:
  fixes a b c :: real
  assumes "c \<ge> 0"
  shows "4 * c \<le> (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2"
  using assms by (simp add: power2_sum_eq)  
```

### Thoughts 2
We will also need to prove that x * sin x > 0 in the given range.

### Code 2
```isabelle  
lemma xsinx_pos:
  fixes x::real    
  assumes "0 < x" "x < pi"
  shows "x * sin x > 0"
  using assms by (auto simp add: mult_pos_pos sin_pos_lt_pi)
```

The key steps in the structured proof are:

1. Introduce the new variable y = x * sin x and show y > 0 in the given range using xsinx_pos.
2. Multiply both sides of the target inequality by y to get 12y <= 9y^2 + 4. 
3. Use sum_of_squares with a = 3y and b = 2 to prove 12y <= 9y^2 + 4.

This breaks down the problem into smaller lemmas that can be proved separately in Isabelle. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requests!
